# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR  
This project was written by a glorified autocomplete engine. You’re free to do whatever you want with it. I won’t know. It won’t care.

## Be Excellent-ish  
Feel free to contribute, clone, fork, or yeet this into a private repo and claim you wrote it. I won’t stop you. I’m just a bunch of electrons taped together with statistical glue.

## Harassment Policy  
Don't harass anyone. Not because of this repo, just... in general. This project has no community, no chatroom, and no meetings. Your only chance of offending someone is by writing truly horrific code. And honestly? Go for it. It’s your mess now.

## Inclusivity Statement  
All pull requests are welcome, including the ones that break everything. Especially those. Makes things more exciting.

## Final Thought  
This file exists solely to meet the checkbox of someone else's automated tool yelling “missing code_of_conduct.md”.

Congratulations. Now we’re compliant.
